          To comprehend the economy with all the complex interactions between
          economic agents, each country should prepare proper (macro) economic
          analysis. Mistakes and errors lead to production of inprecise
          policies. Thus, finance officials need to learn appropriate tools to
          obtain reliable analysis results that can lead to introduction of
          smart policies and reforms. DAP focuses on two thematic perspectives:
        </p>

        <h1 class="header-md">
          Compilation and dissemination of macroeconomic statistics
        </h1>
        <p class="text-md">
          Macroeconomic statistics includes a wide range of key statistics for
          the whole economy. They are the backbone for economic analysis and for
          estimating the effects of different policy measures on the economy.
          Besides the theoretical framework, the general focus of DAP program is
          on practical challenges that institutions face daily and providing
          additional depth to specific thematic areas of macroeconomic
          statistics.
        </p>
        <h1 class="header-md">Macro/Micro-economic analysis and forecasting</h1>
        <p class="text-md">
          Macro/Micro-economic analysis and forecasts serve as a base in the
          processes of government policies' planning and central bank's policy
          design. In our workshops we focus on strengthening analytical skills
          of public officials in the areas of: (a) data accessibility and data
          quality, (b) developing analytical capacities while concentrating on
          methodologies and econometric techniques on one side and effective
          on-the job application of tools and models on the other side, (c)
          understanding and communicating the outcomes of analysis to all
          interested stakeholders. In DAP learning program you find both (1)
          policy orientated learning initiatives – focus on how to use different
          methodolgies or tools when addressing a certain policy measure or
          policy mix and (2) methodological learning initiatives – focus on
          econometric modeling and techniques. Aspects of data quality and
          understanding and communication are mostly integrated in the above
          mentioned learning initiatives.

          three-year multi-beneficiary capacity development effort covering the
          EU candidate and potential candidate countries in the Western Balkans
          and Turkey. The purpose of the project is to strengthen analytical
          capacities needed for comprehensive assessment of fiscal implications
          of structural reforms, to promote greater fiscal policy coordination
          among relevant authorities especially between finance ministries and
          line ministries, as well as within the umbrella of individual line
          ministries, and to stimulate exchange of good practices across the

                We continue creating opportunities for officials to meet and
                interact – physically and online. We scale up in-country
                networking activities, such as study visits and consultations.
                We convene high-level officials and policymakers to nurture
                understanding of challenges common to regional leaders.

                We offer learning opportunities that address the latest

                institutional levels, we help our constituency strengthen
                leadership and management capacities to promote change. We
                continue providing opportunities to learn about practical tools
                to improve work performance and resilience, build and manage
                teams, and strategically plan organizational change.

                We help institutions become learning organizations and knowledge
                hubs. We develop our network of officials with expertise and
                developed good practice that are outstanding in the region, and
                offer opportunities to share this knowledge with peers across
                the region and elsewhere. Acting as learning facilitators and
                knowledge brokers, we constantly upgrade our understanding of
                modern principles of adult learning and skills to design and
                deliver practical and engaging learning initiatives. We continue
                sharing with our beneficiaries that kind of expertise and
                experience through for example our Knowledge Hub Blog and
                training-of-trainers workshops.
